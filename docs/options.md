# Options
There are several options that you can enable when creating a source. The default values for all of these options are `false`. They are designed to be opt-in because they are either experimental or they can make code more prone to bugs.

```js
const Source = createSource({
  key: 'source',
  default: { /* ... */ },
  options: {
    suspense: true | false,
    mutable: true | false,
    virtualBatch: true | false,
  }
})
```

<br/>

## `suspense`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Components that consume the source will be suspended while hydrating.

<br/>

## `mutable`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Setting the value to `false` prevents the state from being tampered by accidentally modifying its value, but can slightly compromise performance. This is because the state is deep-copied. Take note, however that values passes to selectors directly reference to the original state â€” selectors are for selecting values, you should not include any complex logic or try to change the state there.

<br/>

## `virtualBatch`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Slightly improve performance by coalescing the "setState" calls on top of React's batched updates.

This is only suitable for sources that have frequent "`setState`" calls but results in little to no immediate UI changes. For example, a huge [virtualized](http://react-window.now.sh) list which its data is realtime and updated through a listener.

Virtual batching actually creates a delay in component updating, but it's short enough that it's unnoticeable most of the time. Virtual batching is **not suitable** in UIs that updates frequently and needs to be responsive such as forms and text fields.

With virtual batch enabled, if you let a cat run across your keyboard, you are very likely to see the characters slowly appearing one by one.

<br/>

## `public` (New in V1)
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Setting this to `true` will allow state values to be readable from [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) in production mode. You should not change this setting if your state contains sensitive information. State values will always be readable in debug mode.
