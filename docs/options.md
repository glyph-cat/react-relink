# Options
There are several options that you can enable when creating a source. The default values for all of these options are `false`. They are designed to be opt-in because they are either experimental or they can make code more prone to bugs.

```js
const Source = createSource({
  key: 'source',
  default: { /* ... */ },
  options: {
    suspense: true | false,
    mutable: true | false,
    virtualBatch: true | false,
  }
})
```

<br/>

## `suspense`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Components that consume the source will be suspended while hydrating.

<br/>

## `mutable`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Setting the value to `false` prevents the state from being tampered by accidentally modifying its value, but can slightly compromise performance. This is because the state is deep-copied. Take note, however that values passes to selectors directly reference to the original state â€” selectors are for selecting values, you should not include any complex logic or try to change the state there.

NOTE: Relink will be dropping support for immutability in the next major version. This decision has been made because immutability has ended up being more of a liability than a essential feature. Removing this feature can help shrink Relink's package size and increase stability. Besides, what better way is there to achieve immutability for various data types in your projects other than through a custom set of code optimized for them?

<br/>

## `virtualBatch`
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Slightly improve performance by coalescing the "setState" calls on top of React's batched updates.

This is only suitable for sources that have frequent "`setState`" calls but results in little to no immediate UI changes. For example, a huge [virtualized](http://react-window.now.sh) list which its data is realtime and updated through a listener.

Virtual batching actually creates a delay in component updating, but it's short enough that it's unnoticeable most of the time. Virtual batching is **not suitable** in UIs that updates frequently and needs to be responsive such as forms and text fields.

With virtual batch enabled, if you let a cat run across your keyboard, you are very likely to see the characters slowly appearing one by one.

<br/>

## `public` (New in V1)
* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Setting this to `true` will make state values visible in [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) when in production mode. You should not change this option if your state contains sensitive information. State values will always be visible in debug mode.
