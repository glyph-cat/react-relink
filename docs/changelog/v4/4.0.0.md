# Support for Concurrent Rendering
This version adds compatibility for React 18's [concurrent rendering](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) by using the [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore) hook.

<br/>

# Deprecated option: `virtualBatch`
Previously, Relink implements its own hook to subscribe to sources, watch for state changes, then decide if a component should update; but with [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore), Relink no longer has control over when to trigger component updates.

On the flipside, even though there is no 1:1 substitution, [concurrent rendering](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) might just be able to solve the problem `virtualBatch` has been trying to solve since day one — to make it possible to defer component updates for complicated states.

In fact, concurrent rendering provides a more granular control: in a sense that you can now tell React which "set state" calls are urgent and which ones are not, instead of only distinguishing them by sources.

# Note: Basic selectors do not need to be memoized

```tsx
// ✅ OK
function SomeComponent(): JSX.Element {
  const someState = useRelinkValue(SomeSource, (state) => state.foo)
  return /* ... */
}
```

```tsx
// ✅ Also OK
// Ideal for sharing with components in other files in a consistently manner.
export const someSelector = (state) => state.foo

function SomeComponent(): JSX.Element {
  const someState = useRelinkValue(SomeSource, someSelector)
  return /* ... */
}
```

```tsx
// ❌ Unnecessary
function SomeComponent(): JSX.Element {
  const selector = useCallback((state) => state.foo, [])
  const someState = useRelinkValue(SomeSource, selector)
  return /* ... */
}
```

# Removal of deprecated APIs

These APIs are marked as deprecated in the previous version and is no longer included in this version.

* (deprecated -> new)
* `createSource` -> `new RelinkSource(...)`
* `isRelinkSource` -> `value instanceof RelinkSource`

# New exposed constants

(Probably rarely used)

* `BUILD_HASH`
* `BUILD_TYPE`
* `RelinkBuildType`
