* Fixed bug where error message is not shown if the the `mutable` option is still passed as an option when calling `createSource`.
* `RelinkSource` has been marked as deprecated, please use `RelinkSourceSchema` instead.
* `RelinkSourceEntry` has been marked as deprecated, please use `RelinkSourceConfig` instead.
