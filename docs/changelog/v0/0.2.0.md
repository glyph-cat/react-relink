* Source dependencies - If a source depends on other sources, it will wait until all of its dependencies are hydrated before hydrating itself.
* Relink now internally uses [`fast-copy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-copy) for cloning states instead of `lodash.clonedeep`.
* "dangerously-" methods have been deprecated, you can now call methods on the sources directly. 
  * `dangerouslyGetRelinkValue()` -> `Source.get()`
  * `dangerouslySetRelinkValue()` -> `Source.set()`
  * `dangerouslyResetRelinkValue()` -> `Source.reset()`
  * `dangerouslyRehydrateRelinkSource()` -> `Source.hydrate()`
* Additional `Source.addListener()` and `Source.removeListener()` methods are also exposed.
* `RelinkLifecycleConfig` & `RelinkSourceOptions` are now available as TypeScript definition exports.
* Perviously deep comparison is performed to compare previous and current states. Now, if `options.mutable` is set to `true`, `Object.is` comparison will be used instead.
