* Out of concerns for performance, mutability will be enabled by default starting from V1. To opt out of this change, you should set  `mutable: false` under options in `createSource` starting from this version.

```js
const MySource = createSource({
  default: someDefaultValue,
  options: {
    mutable: false,
  },
})
```
