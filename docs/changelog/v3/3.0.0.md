* `RelinkSourceEntry` has been renamed to `RelinkSourceConfig`.
* `RelinkSource` which is originally an interface is now a class.
* `createSource` has been deprecated. To create sources starting from this v3, use `new RelinkSource(...)` instead.
* `isRelinkSource` has been deprecated, to check if an object is a Relink source, use the `instanceof` keyword instead.
```js
if (value instanceof RelinkSource) {
  // Is RelinkSource
} else {
  // Is another data type
}
```
