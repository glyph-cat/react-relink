// === Local Notes ===
// [A] This allows the execution to be synchronous if the reducer is also
//     synchronous. Consider the code below:
//     ```js
//     nextState = isThenable(executedReducer)
//       ? await executedReducer
//       : executedReducer
//     ```
//
//     This would make the execution asynchronous regardless of whether or not
//     the reducer is asynchronous and code would look like this:
//     ```js
//     .M$exec(async (): Promise<void> => { ...
//     ```
//
//     And for unclear reasons, this creates a delay in integration tests that
//     would result in inaccurate assertions. At the same time, if, by
//     conditionally making the execution asynchronous eliminates unnecessary
//     delay, this also means we get a little bit of performance gain.
