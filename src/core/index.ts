// [A] If incoming state is not provided, it defaults to the omission marker in
//     `M$dynamicSet` and `M$hydrate`. This way, we won't mix up with falsey
//     values because the object reference is clearly different.
// [B] By using the getter `M$get()` whenever we need to access the current
//     state, this guarantees a consistent behaviour every-fucking-where in
//     terms of mutability â€”â€” and this preserves sanity.
